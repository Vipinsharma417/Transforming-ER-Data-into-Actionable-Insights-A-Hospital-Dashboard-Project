# Transforming-ER-Data-into-Actionable-Insights-A-Hospital-Dashboard-Project
I’m excited to share a data visualization project I recently completed, focusing on optimizing Emergency Room operations through three dynamic dashboards built for a hospital system. 💡

🧩 Business Requirement:
The hospital needed a way to:

Monitor key ER performance KPIs daily and monthly

Understand patient demographics and referral trends

Drill down into individual patient data for detailed analysis

🛠 My Solution:
I developed three interactive Power BI dashboards:

✅ Monthly View Dashboard

📈 Sparkline trends for KPIs like number of patients, wait times, satisfaction scores, and referrals

🔍 Visuals for gender, age group, race, and hourly traffic trends

🚨 Real-time insight into admission status and timely service metrics

✅ Consolidated View Dashboard

🗓️ Comprehensive performance overview over a selected date range

📊 Aggregated metrics to identify long-term trends and strategic gaps

🧠 Ideal for decision-makers to optimize staffing, departmental load, and patient care efficiency

✅ Patient Details Dashboard

🔎 Row-level breakdown of patient data (ID, name, gender, wait time, department referrals, and status)

🔐 Designed for operational deep-dives and troubleshooting

🔍 Key KPIs Addressed:
Total patients per day and month

Avg. wait time (with daily fluctuations)

Satisfaction scores over time

Referral volumes by department

Demographic insights (gender, age, race)

Timeliness of care (% seen within 30 mins)

💡 Tools Used: Power BI | DAX | Data Modeling | UI/UX for Dashboards

This project helped turn raw hospital data into a decision-making engine — improving care quality, resource allocation, and operational clarity.
